# alfred-2do

Tried to mimic natural language to create a 2Do task.

USAGE:

```
2d event [[today][tomorrow] on [11][feb 11][11 feb 2018][wed][wednesday][2/11]] [at [9][9:30][pm]] [@[list]] [#[tag]] [[*][**][***]]
```

\+ This workflow will automatically detect and add webpage url currently you're watching as an action to open the webpage.

caveat: It takes bit of time for this script to dissect your input and understand your intention. So it is recommended you **pause 1 second before pressing return key** to create a new task. I'm looking for ways to solve this issue.

Many thanks to Fahad G. for providing icons :D Black icons are also included in case you're using light alfred theme. All the icons are edited based on original icon provided.

Also big shout out to [@doomsheart](https://github.com/doomsheart) reviewing the whole code for me.

Massive shout out to [@hylo](https://github.com/hylo926) for contribution.

based on the work of [2Do Workflow by Caleb Grove](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/3811-2do-workflow/?do=findComment&comment=22721)
