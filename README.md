# alfred-2do

tried to mimic natural language to create a 2do task.

USAGE:

```
2d event [today][tomorrow] on [11][feb 11][11 feb 2018][2/11][wed][wednesday] at [9][9:30][pm] in [location] @[list] #[tag] [*][**][***]
```

\+ This workflow will automatically detect and add webpage url currently you're watching as an action to open the webpage.

based on the work of [2Do Workflow by Caleb Grove](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/3811-2do-workflow/?do=findComment&comment=22721)
