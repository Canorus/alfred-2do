# alfred-2do

tried to mimic natural language to create a 2do task.

USAGE:

```
2d event [[today][tomorrow] on [11][feb 11][11 feb 2018][2/11][wed][wednesday]] [at [9][9:30][pm]] [in [location]] [@[list]] [#[tag]] [[*][**][***]]
```

\+ This workflow will automatically detect and add webpage url currently you're watching as an action to open the webpage.

caveat: It takes bit of time for this script to dissect your input and understand your intention. So it is recommended you pause 1 second before pressing return key to add task. I'm looking for ways to solve this issue.

Many thanks to Fahad G. for icons :D
